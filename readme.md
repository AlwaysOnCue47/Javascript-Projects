# The Adventures of Learning to Code

## This repository is used for my educational journey

This repository contains the files for my Javascript course.

### Some of the projects I have made in my JavaScript course are:
  - Tic-Tac-Toe Game
  - Basic Calculator
  - A To-Do list

I also applied the knowledge I learned to make a custom slot-machine game. The game utilizes random numbers, manipulates the DOM to display and hide images and tracks the players' winnings.  You can find that in my JavaScript Repository under Test Folder
